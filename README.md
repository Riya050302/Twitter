## Camera part:

* A baseline for uploading random jpg image to S3 bucket (image storage AWS database) is estalished
* A dynamodb database for storing time of upload(time of detection of birds) and file name is established
* A proper way of extracting the dynamodb information to node.js is created, with a proper image url and timestamp
* A rough display is made in react to display the images according to timestamp order
